'The program is not only about its recognition capabilities, but also its holistic approach'

Our program embarks on a journey that begins with data collection and careful video segmentation. We carefully select video clips, selecting those that feature such different objects as Phantom 4, Bayraktar TB2. Using manual segmentation, we ensure that our dataset is not only broad, but also finely tuned, focusing on segments where targets are prominent.
Once the groundwork is laid, we proceed to extract frames from these videos, converting them into an image sequence. These images then undergo extensive data pre-processing, a critical step that standardizes their size and pixel values, providing consistency for our deep learning models.
The essence of our program is to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, the formidable YOLOv5, to perform object recognition. We tailor model parameters, customize model configurations, and provide extensive training to achieve the highest level of accuracy.
The program is not only about its recognition capabilities, but also its holistic approach. It includes rigorous model evaluation, seamless integration of real-time object detection, and intuitive data visualization tools. Rigorous testing ensures the program's accuracy and reliability, and a robust database system stores critical information including source and detected images, detection statistics, unique image IDs and image names, carefully archiving both the Excel file and the SQLite database.
As we complete the program, we do so with a focus on user friendliness, scalability, and adaptability.
This structured architecture not only offers comprehensive object recognition, but also a foundation for future recognition and data analysis tasks.
